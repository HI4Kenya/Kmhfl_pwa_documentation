Overview
========
The Kenya Master Health Facility List application is basically built for the public. It provides listings for health 
services provided by the ministry of health,non-governmnental organisations and faith-based organisations across the 
country. Identification of nearby facilities in regard to the health service needed is made possible  which is indeed 
a helpful thing when someone needs to find a health facility around the place they are. It also gives an opportunity 
to comment on how well the health facilities served you. The app works with the geolocator which aids in mapping the 
location of the user. Sections of the dashboard, registered facilities and the facility locator are provided to help
easen using the application.
