CHAPTER 3:Registered Facilities
================================
This area provides an option of searching the service you need 
per the location that you are in.
For example: The service card has a dropdown on which you can 
search service needed by clicking on one of the services. This is
to be done the same with other cards such as county,subcounty and
ward.
Details of what you want will then be listed.
